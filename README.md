Learn PyCharm by _Using_ PyCharm.

# Lesson 0: START HERE!

1. Install [PyCharm Community Edition](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
2. Clone this repo, `git clone https://github.com/tsclausing/pycharmtutor.git`
3. Then, `charm pycharmtutor`

If step 3 doesn't open the pycharmtutor project in PyCharm, try opening PyCharm
the old fashioned way, then and choose "Open Directory" from the welcome screen and
select your cloned pycharmtutor directory.

From the PyCharm menu, select `Run -> Run...` and hit return to select the default
test configuration and run the Unittests!

__You're in.__ Read the test console output for next steps. All of the PyCharm Tutor(ial)
lessons are python files meant to be viewed *in* PyCharm.  Read everything, try
anything, have fun :)
